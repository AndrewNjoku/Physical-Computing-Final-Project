1. TOOGOO(R) USB to 5.5mm / 2.1mm 5V DC Barrel Jack Power Cable

This is the DC cable that connects to the power adapter. It will be plugged into the portable charging unit.
We have calculated that in order to power the LED matrix we will need this source of power solely  at 5 Volts and 2 Amps.

2.Female DC Power adapter - 2.1mm jack to screw terminal block

This adapter attaches to a wire connected to the back of the RGB LED matrix.


3.Adafruit 16x32 RGB LED matrix panel

The main component of our project this LED matrix takes up 12 Digital pins usually and requires 5 volts and 2 amps.
Also in order to save pins in this project we will be
