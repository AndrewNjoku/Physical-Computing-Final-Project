  Thursday, 2pm-6pm, Obum and Andria: 
  
  Today we set out to research the specifications for our project and envisioned what we wanted to achieve.
  We went to the SU and brainstormed the engineering requirements of our project. We made a shopping list which were all the components
  we believed we would need in order to fulfill our proposed plan. We spent a lot of time thinking about important aspects of our project such as 
  power draw and how to power some of the more hungry components such as the LED matrix and mini LCD screens. We made these calculations and also read
  up on installation guides for some of the components. This allowed us to make some notes on how we would go about installing the components 
  when they arrived and allowed us to make best use of our time while we where waiting for the componets to arrive.
