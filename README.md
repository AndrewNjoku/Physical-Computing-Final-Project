Name of project: Brain Twister

Description: One of our ideas for our physical computing final project, is an interactive game using led matrix and capacitive touch sensors. It is a handheld gaming device with a 32x16 adafruit LED matrix screen . There will be different mini games animated on both sides of the  LED matrix simultaneously which the user can play and interactive with using the capacitive buttons which will update their actions based on the game on the screen. The whole point of this device is to try and play these different games simultaneously and get the highest score. 

Name of partners:
•	Obum Malu
•	Andria Njoku

Inputs:     
•	Capacitive touch buttons Digital – For detecting touch of buttons
•	Shake detection (accelerometer)(Analogue)- For game integration
•	Potentiometer(Anologue)- For changing difficulty

Outputs:
•	Led Animation – Led animations making up minigames
•	Sound effects – Sound effects for feedback
Housing/ Materials:
We will 3D print the housing for the device. The drawing below is a rough outline of how the device will look. It will be handheld and made to be held in two hands comfortably. The housing will be made out of ABS.
Components required:

Upon doing some initial research here is the rough list of components we think we will need.
•	16x32 Adafruit LED Matrix  ( For the display and LED animations)
•	Shield to mount the Matrix (if needed)
•	Potentiometer (control difficulty)
•	Arduino Uno (Micro controller)
•	Adafruit 12 x Capacitive Touch Shield for Arduino (for capacitive buttons)
•	Some sort of display for  changing button animation (haven’t figured out yet)
•	Speaker (audio feedback)


How it will be presented: Due to the interactivity of our project goal device we feel the best way to represent and showcase it would be via a video demonstrating one of us playing the device and talking through how it works and was built.
